\chapter{Method}\label{s:method}

In this chapter, first, we describe how we obtained the information
from the build system of \emph{Business Central} for the pipeline under study, 
along with the required changes to collect coverage information.

Afterwards, in section \ref{s:method-characterizing-testruns}, we describe how we obtain features for
the collected changes and test runs. These features are used to numerically represent a 
test run in a CI job. This representation is suitable to be used as the input of ranking algorithms.

Afterwards, in section \ref{s:method-prioritizing-testruns}, we describe how we label
the training datasets. That is, the different criteria used to assign priorities to
the given tests.

Finally, in section \ref{s:method-training-models}, we describe the training of the 
different ranking models, with different datasets.
