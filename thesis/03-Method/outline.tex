\section{Outline}

In the existing research, datasets have been constructed focusing on test run properties 
and results. For instance, Spieker in \ref{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1811-04122} worked on ??. 
And Bertolino et. al. in \ref{Bertolino2020LearningtoRankVR} evaluate their algorithms 
by constructing a dataset from the Apache Commons projects commit history.

In section \ref{s:method-collecting-dataset}, we describe how we obtained the information
from the \emph{Business Central} build system, along with the required changes to collect 
coverage information.

In section \ref{s:method-characterizing-testruns}, we describe how we obtain features for
the collected changes and test runs. These features are used to numerically represent a 
test run in a CI job, for them to be input of the ranking algorithms.

Afterwards, in section \ref{s:method-prioritizing-testruns}, we describe how we label
the training dataset. That is, the different criteria used to assign priorities to
the given tests.

Finally, in section \ref{s:method-training-models}, we describe the training of the 
different ranking models, with different datasets.
