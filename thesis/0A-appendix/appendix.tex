\chapter{Evaluation results}
\label{sec:appendix-evaluation-results}
For completeness, we present a list of the main metrics obtained
for the different algorithms, ranking configurations and hyperparameters considered.

More concretely, we present the distribution metrics of $NAPFD$ and $t_{ff}$
of each different configuration. We also present the size of the induced selections
of each configuration and their corresponding execution times.

More values and distribution plots can be found in the accompanying repository
of this project.
