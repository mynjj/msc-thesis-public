\begin{abstract}
In this project we present the evaluation of test selection and prioritization techniques, with data 
collected from a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline of the \emph{Business Central} project.

We reduce the test prioritization problem to a ranking problem. This is done by computing 
properties for the given changes to the codebase and using them as input vectors to 
different ranking algorithms. In contrast to existing research, we use different properties;
most notably, the usage of test coverage information. 

Having an effective technique for test prioritization in a project is relevant in Continuous Integration
pipelines. Their execution can be time consuming and energy inefficient. Furthermore, these are typically executed
multiple times per day in a large team. Speed and efficiency not only benefits the development cycles, but overall development
costs and energy impact.

Our results show that using coverage information for assigning priorities increases the effectiveness of
the prioritization proposed. However, using coverage information as part of the feature vectors reduces
its effectiveness and increases the variance of the results for the datasets created.

Based on these results, we argue that with the proposed prioritization algorithms we would be able to reduce 
the amount of tests that were run by 60\% using a conservative estimate of the best performing algorithm,
which corresponds to an execution time improvement of 90\% in average. This suggests that these approaches
are well suited for the pipeline under study.

We also give an outline on how this prioritization could be integrated in different stages 
of the existing pipeline.
